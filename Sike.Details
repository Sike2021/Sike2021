👋 Hi, I’m @Sike2021!

👀 I’m passionate about writing, storytelling, and game development, especially creating unique worlds and immersive narratives.

🌱 I’m currently learning web development, game simulation programming, and exploring ways to turn my ideas into interactive experiences.

💾 I’ve developed Cricket 25 Simulate, a simple yet engaging cricket simulation game! Feel free to check out the code and contribute to making it even better.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to creative writing, fantasy/sci-fi stories, and game mechanics.
